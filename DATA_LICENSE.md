## Training Data Provenance

| Corpus | Source | License | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| `names.txt` | US Census name frequency data | **Public domain** | Factual data, not copyrightable |
| `shakespeare.txt` | Complete works of William Shakespeare | **Public domain** | All works published before 1928 |
| `c_functions.txt` | Original C implementations by the author | **MIT** | Written specifically for this project |
| `c_wiring.txt` | Original C function compositions by the author | **MIT** | Written specifically for this project |
| `puzzle8_*.txt` | Generated by `generate_corpus.py` from game rules | **MIT** | Algorithmic output, no third-party data |
| `tictactoe_*.txt` | Generated by `generate_corpus.py` from game rules | **MIT** | Algorithmic output, no third-party data |
| `connect4_*.txt` | Generated by `generate_corpus.py` from game rules | **MIT** | Algorithmic output, no third-party data |

> **Game rule corpora** (puzzle, tic-tac-toe, Connect-4) are generated entirely by our Python scripts using minimax/BFS algorithms. Game rules are not copyrightable. The generated positions and optimal moves are factual data.

## Trained Model Checkpoints

Checkpoint files (`.ckpt`) contain model weights, Adam optimizer state, and a step counter. They are **derived works** of:

1. The MicroGPT-C engine (MIT licensed)
2. The training corpus used to produce them

### Checkpoints included in this repository

| Checkpoint | Training Data | Derived License |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| `shakespeare.ckpt` | Public domain Shakespeare text | **MIT** |
| `names.ckpt` | Public domain Census names | **MIT** |
| Any organelle `.ckpt` | MIT-licensed original corpora | **MIT** |

All checkpoints distributed with this repository are released under the **MIT License**.

### Checkpoints you train yourself

If you train a MicroGPT-C organelle on **your own data**, the checkpoint is yours — the MIT engine license does not restrict your use of derived model weights.

If you train on **third-party data**, the checkpoint may inherit licensing restrictions from that data. This is a legally evolving area. Our guidance:

| Training Data License | Checkpoint Status | Recommendation |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Public domain | Unrestricted | ✅ Safe to distribute |
| MIT / Apache / BSD | Likely unrestricted | ✅ Check original license terms |
| GPL | Possibly copyleft | ⚠️ Consult legal counsel |
| Proprietary / NDA | Restricted | ⛔ Do not distribute |
| Scraped web content | Uncertain | ⚠️ Verify source permissions |

## Generated Text Is Not Endorsed

Text generated by MicroGPT-C models reflects statistical patterns in the training data, **not the views of the author or Enjector Software Ltd.** Models may reproduce biases present in their training corpora.

## Contributing Data

If you contribute a new training corpus to this project:

1. You must have the right to distribute the data under the MIT license
2. State the data source and its license in this document
3. If the data derives from a third party, include their license notice
4. Do not contribute data containing personally identifiable information (PII) without anonymisation
